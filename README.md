## Library Database with SQLAlchemy <h2> 
  
  #### Python, SQLite3 and SQLAlchemy are used in this project. <h2> 
  
 Firstly,Download Python on computer with https://www.python.org/downloads/, if you already have,just ignore this step.
  
 Versions of Python since 2.5 have the SQLite3 module built in to the standard install so you dont have to install it.
   All you have to do is to fire up the Python shell and import the module:
>>> import sqlite3
  
 Then,you should install SQLAlchemy 1.4.15. SQLAlchemy is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL. If you use Linux,you could write  **pip install SQLAlchemy** on linux terminal to download SQLAlchemy. For more information [SQLAlchemy](https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/en/14)
  
  In addition,I use Conda.Conda is a powerful package manager and environment manager that you use with command line commands at the Anaconda Prompt for Windows, or in a terminal window for macOS or Linux.
